# CodaHale Aggregated Metrics CloudWatch Reporter

This is a CloudWatch Reporter for the stable version of Dropwizard Metrics (formerly CodaHale & Yammer Metrics). The reporter is an implementation of [ScheduledReporter](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/ScheduledReporter.html) from Dropwizard Metrics v4.0.2

### Prerequisites

- Java 1.8

### Summary

- This CloudWatchReporter reports the metric data to CloudWatch asynchronously using the [CloudWatchAsyncClient (AWS)](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/cloudwatch/CloudWatchAsyncClient.html) interface
- Each reportable value in CodeHale [Metric](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Metric.html) is reported as a separate [MetricDatum (AWS)](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/cloudwatch/model/MetricDatum.html)
- When reporting [Meter](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Meter.html), [Counter](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Counter.html), [Histogram](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Histogram.html) and [Timer](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Timer.html) count metrics (`getCount()`) as [MetricDatum (AWS)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/cloudwatch/model/MetricDatum.html), only the count difference since the last report is reported. This way the counters do not require a reset within the application using this reporter.
- If configured, each [Snapshot](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Snapshot.html) translated into [StatisticSet (AWS)](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/cloudwatch/model/StatisticSet.html) in the most direct way possible.
- If configured, JVM statistic is reported

### Reportable Metrics

Currently the only metric values that are reportable through configuration are:

- Values of type `Number` from [Gauge](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Gauge.html)
- Counts from [Counter](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Counter.html), [Histogram](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Histogram.html), [Meter](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Meter.html) and [Timer](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Timer.html)
- Percentiles from [Snapshot](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Snapshot.html) in [Histogram](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Histogram.html) and [Timer](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Timer.html)
- Arithmetic mean & standard deviation of [Snapshot](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Snapshot.html) values in [Histogram](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Histogram.html) and [Timer](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Timer.html)
- Mean rates from [Meter](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Meter.html) and [Timer](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Timer.html)
- Summaries of [Snapshot](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Snapshot.html) values in [Histogram](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Histogram.html) and [Timer](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Timer.html) as [StatisticSet (AWS)](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/cloudwatch/model/StatisticSet.html)

__Please note__:

- [Histogram](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Histogram.html) values (the `percentiles`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, `arithmetic mean` & `std-dev` from [Snapshot](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Snapshot.html)) are reported __raw__.
- [Timer](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Timer.html) values (the `percentiles`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, `arithmetic mean` & `std-dev` from [Snapshot](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Snapshot.html)) are reported after conversion by a duration factor was applied. The duration factor is calculated by converting `1` unit of `duration unit` type to `nanoseconds` (see [ScheduledReporter](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/ScheduledReporter.html))
- [Meter](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Meter.html) values (the `1min rate`, `5min rate`, `15min rate` & `mean rate`) are reported after conversion by a rate factor was applied. The rate factor is calculated by converting `1` unit of `rate unit` type to `seconds` (see [ScheduledReporter](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/ScheduledReporter.html)). The Unit of the sent MetricDatum will default to that `rate unit` if not changed with `builder.withMeterUnitSentToCW()`.

### Metric Dimensions
A dimension is a name/value pair that helps you to uniquely identify a metric. Every metric has specific characteristics that describe
it, and you can think of dimensions as categories for those characteristics.

#### Global Dimensions
The reporter can be configured with a set of global dimensions. These will be added to all reported metrics.

#### Per Metric Dimensions
The reporter will look for dimensions encoded in the metric name when the metric is reported.
To add dimensions to a metric, encode them inside square brackets at the end of the metric name;

`"metricName[dimension1:value1,dimension2:value2]"`

Use `DimensionedName` to more easily create metric names with dimensions;

```java
final DimensionedName dimensionedName = DimensionedName.withName("test")
        .withDimension("key1", "val1")
        .withDimension("key2", "val2")
        .withDimension("key3", "val3")
        .build();

metricRegistry.counter(dimensionedName.encode()).inc();
````

It's also possible to derive a new `DimensionedName` from an existing one; 
```java
final DimensionedName dimensionedName = DimensionedName
        .withName("test")
        .withDimension("key1", "val1")
        .withDimension("key2", "val2")
        .withDimension("key3", "val3")
        .build();

final DimensionedName derivedDimensionedName = dimensionedName
        .withDimension("key3", "replaced_value")
        .withDimension("key4", "val4")
        .build();

metricRegistry.counter(dimensionedName.encode()).inc();
metricRegistry.counter(derivedDimensionedName.encode()).inc();
````

Since `DimensionedName` is immutable, the string representation returned by `encode()` is cached. Multiple calls to `encode()` will return the same `String`. 

### Defaults

The Reporter uses the following defaults which can be configured:

- Rate metrics are in `TimeUnit.SECONDS`
- Duration metrics are in `TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS`
- `MetricFilter.ALL` will be used for the Filter
- `Clock.defaultClock()` will be used for the Clock (Unconfigurable)
- Metrics are reported using standard resolution (can be changed to [high resolution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics))
- Empty global [Dimension (AWS)](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/cloudwatch/model/Dimension.html) list
- The reporter adds a `Type` [Dimension (AWS)](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/cloudwatch/model/Dimension.html) to each reported metric, e.g:

| Type                                      | Metric Name                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-min-mean-rate   [per-second]            | com.example.component.SomeComponent.timer                       |
| snapshot-mean     [in-milliseconds]       | com.example.component.SomeComponent.timer                       |
| snapshot-mean                             | com.example.component.SomeComponent.histogram                   |
| 95%                                       | com.example.component.SomeComponent.timer                       |
| 99.5%                                     | com.example.component.SomeComponent.timer                       |
| 99.5%                                     | com.example.component.SomeComponent.histogram                   |
| count                                     | com.example.component.SomeComponent.counter                     |

The __only__ metrics that are reportable __by default__  are:

- Count values (`getCount()`) from [Meter](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Meter.html), [Counter](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Counter.html), [Histogram](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Histogram.html) and [Timer](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Timer.html) 
- Percentile values (`75%`, `95%`, `99.9%`) from [Histogram](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Histogram.html) and [Timer](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Timer.html)

All other metrics have to be configured for reporting by invoking their respective `withXXXX()` methods on the `CloudWatchReporter.Builder` instance


### Adding cloudwatch reporter to your project

The library artifact ID is `dropwizard-metrics-cloudwatch` if you want to [search for it on Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22dropwizard-metrics-cloudwatch%22)

The following is an example how to include the library in your project using Gradle:

```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies { 
    compile("io.github.mmccuiston:dropwizard-metrics-cloudwatch:1.0.14")
}
```

### Third-party dependencies

The library fetches the following transitive dependencies:

```
    io.dropwizard.metrics:metrics-core:4.0.2
    io.dropwizard.metrics:metrics-jvm:4.0.2
    software.amazon.awssdk:cloudwatch:2.7.19
```



### Usage

The reporter provides a fine-grained configuration options through its builder to configure what metrics should be reported to CloudWatch. Since AWS costs money, you probably do not want to report `all` the values from [Metric](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Metric.html) classes or [Snapshot](https://static.javadoc.io/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.0.2/com/codahale/metrics/Snapshot.html), but only what's really useful to you.


```
    final CloudWatchAsyncClient amazonCloudWatchAsync =
            CloudWatchAsyncClient
                    .builder()
                    .region(Region.US_WEST_2)
                    .build();

    final CloudWatchReporter cloudWatchReporter =
            CloudWatchReporter.forRegistry(metricRegistry, amazonCloudWatchAsync, Main.class.getName())
                    .convertRatesTo(TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                    .convertDurationsTo(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
                    .filter(MetricFilter.ALL)
                    .withPercentiles(Percentile.P75, Percentile.P99)
                    .withOneMinuteMeanRate()
                    .withFiveMinuteMeanRate()
                    .withFifteenMinuteMeanRate()
                    .withMeanRate()
                    .withArithmeticMean()
                    .withStdDev()
                    .withStatisticSet()
                    .withZeroValuesSubmission()
                    .withReportRawCountValue()
                    .withHighResolution()
                    .withMeterUnitSentToCW(StandardUnit.BYTES)
                    .withJvmMetrics()
                    .withGlobalDimensions("Region=us-west-2", "Instance=stage")
                    .withDryRun()
                    .build();

    cloudWatchReporter.start(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```


#### Dry run
The reporter can be configured to run in `DRY RUN` mode by invoking `.withDryRun()` on the `Builder`. In that case, the reporter will `log.DEBUG` the created instance of [PutMetricDataRequest (AWS)](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/cloudwatch/model/PutMetricDataRequest.html), instead of doing a real `POST` to CloudWatch.
